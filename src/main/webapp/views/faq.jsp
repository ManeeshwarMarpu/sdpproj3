            <p class="favourite-place-card-description">
                Home loan is a loan disbursed by a bank
                or financial institution (lender) to an individual specifically for
                buying a residential property. Here, the lender holds the title of
                property until the loan is paid back in full along with interest.</p>

              What is the tenure of a home loan?</button>
          </h2>
        </div>
      

          <p class="favourite-place-card-description">
          Home loans are long term borrowing
            instruments with a minimum tenure of 5 years and a maximum tenure
            of 30 years. The tenure offered to you for your personal loan
            depends on the loan amount that is sanctioned to you by the lender
            along with other factors.</p>

              What is a fixed rate home loan?</button>
          </h2>
        </div>
          <p class="favourite-place-card-description">
            Fixed rate home loans are offered at a
					predetermined interest rate during the loan period and these remain
					unchanged during the loan period irrespective of market conditions.
					This can be a huge benefit when market volatility starts affecting
					interest rates. For instance, if the RBI increases interest rates
					on loans, then people with fixed rate home loan will not be
					affected by any increase or decrease in the market interest rates
					and the EMI amount will remain unchanged. This type of home loan is
					less popular these days.

          </h2>
        </div>
          <p class="favourite-place-card-description">
            Anyone - whether self employed or
					salaried individuals/professionals - with a regular source of
					income can apply for home loans. One must be at least 21 years old
					when the loan period begins and should not exceed an age of 65
					years when the loan ends or at the time of superannuation. This is
					the generic home loan eligibility criteria and specifics such as
					the minimum and maximum age limits, minimum income level, etc. may
					differ from one lender to another.

            <p class="favourite-place-card-description">
              There are different ways to pay off
					your loan such as issuing post-dated cheques for the tenure of the
					home loan, getting the amount deducted automatically from your
					salary or by issuing standard instructions to the lender for ECS
					(Electronic Clearing System) wherein the EMI is automatically
					deducted from your bank every month.

                Once repayment capacity determines your eligibility to apply for

                  Yes, one can repay the loan amount
                  before completion of the scheduled loan tenure by making a lump sum
                  payment towards paying off the loan. In such cases, the bank may
                  decide to apply some penalties in the range 2-3% of the principal
                  amount outstanding. Some banks and NMFC (non-banking financial
                  companies) do not charge any penalty on making prepayment of a home
                  loan.

                    Before zeroing in on a home loan, it is
                    best to compare the various interest rates that would be applicable
                    to you. When you apply for a home loan through Paisabazaar, you get
                    the opportunity to apply for a home loan through both private and
                    public-sector banks. Also take into account, the fact that banks
                    charge various processing and other related fees when you apply for
                    a home loan and you should also consider these, when applying for a
                    home loan.

                  </div>
                    <p class="favourite-place-card-description">
                      1. Processing Fee- When applying for a loan, a fee is paid to the
				lender known as processing fee. The amount paid could be either a
				percentage of the loan amount or a fixed amount that is paid in lieu
				of carrying out the loan sanction formalities.<br> 2.
				Commitment Fee- It is essential to avail the loan within a
				stipulated time period after it is processed and sanctioned
				otherwise some financial institutions levy a commitment fee. By
				paying the commitment fee, you are assured that you can access the
				loan at the interest rate and for the tenure that was initially
				agreed on. Most banks no longer charge this fee.<br> 3.
				Pre-payment Charges- Banks/ financial institutions might charge a
				penalty if the entire loan amount is paid off before completion of
				the loan tenure. The penalty amount also known as
				foreclosure/pre-payment charges could be a maximum of 5% of the loan
				amount that is paid off before the completion of loan tenure.<br>
				4. Miscellaneous charges- Documentation, stamp duty, credit bureau
				report issuance charges and consultant charges are generally
				considered as miscellaneous charges by few lenders.
